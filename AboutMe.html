<h1>So...Who am I?<h1>
<p> I am Teena Jesinth Joyce Benhur. I was born and raised in Chennai, India, but I also pursued education in the US. I am a multitasker and a designer, whether it's in jewelry or on my computer. I am passionate about bringing my designs to life. My hobbies include reading, dancing, playing drums, and baking. </p>

<p>I am a graduate with a technical and creative background and experience in marketing. I studied high school in Missouri, USA, where I was fully immersed in a technological environment. I learned how design and technology can coexist, and I found my passion for designing not on paper but on the computer. I pursued Information Technology at Rajalakshmi Engineering College, Chennai, India, where I learned coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Later, I pursued the course Interactive Digital Media at Trinity College Dublin, Ireland, which was a dream come true. The course introduced me to various types of design media, different software, and techniques.</p> 

<p>I still have a lot to learn as technology evolves along with new techniques but I am evolving too and I will keep learning and putting my skills to the test. Check out my portfolio and resume to know more. Check out my portfolio and my resume ot know more about my works.</p>
